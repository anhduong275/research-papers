# Abstract
The system can learn to simulate tennis playing through widely available broadcast videos of tennis. The system consists of a low level imitation policy and a high level motion planning policy.
When trained on large datasets, it seamlessly connects shots into actual games, where it simulates 2 characters playing with each other. The strokes and learning styles are diverse, and motions are
accurate enough to hit the ball.
